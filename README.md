# Features:
+ Easy to use

+ Productivity-focussed UI/UX design
# Uses:
1. ## Task organization:
   A to-do list provides a structured way to organize tasks. It allows you to list all the jobs that need to be done, making it easier to visualize and prioritize your work.
2. ## Task prioritization:
   With a to-do list, you can assign priorities to tasks by ordering them accordingly. By categorizing tasks as high, medium, or low priority, you can focus on the most important ones and ensure they are completed first.
3. ## Time management:
   A to-do list helps you manage your time more effectively. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, actionable items, you can allocate appropriate time for each job and set realistic deadlines.
4. ## Reduced stress:
   By having a clear overview of your tasks and a plan to tackle them, a todo list helps reduce stress and anxiety. It provides a sense of control over your workload and ensures that nothing important is forgotten or neglected.

   A to-do list can greatly enhance your organization, productivity, and overall effectiveness in managing tasks and responsibilities.
