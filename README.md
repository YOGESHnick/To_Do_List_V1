2. ## Task prioritization:
   With a to-do list, you can assign priorities to tasks by ordering them accordingly. By categorizing tasks as high, medium, or low priority, you can focus on the most important ones and ensure they are completed first.

   A to-do list helps you manage your time more effectively. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, actionable items, you can allocate appropriate time for each job and set realistic deadlines.
4. ## Reduced stress:
   By having a clear overview of your tasks and a plan to tackle them, a todo list helps reduce stress and anxiety. It provides a sense of control over your workload and ensures that nothing important is forgotten or neglected.
